# Integration Test Summary

The integration between uploaded images and AI generation has been successfully implemented:

## Completed Integration Points

### 1. ImageUploadSection Component ✅
- ✅ Added `onImagesChange` callback prop
- ✅ Properly calls parent notification on image add/remove
- ✅ Maintains uploaded images state with Base64 data URLs

### 2. RightSidebar Component ✅
- ✅ Added `UploadedImage` interface
- ✅ Added `onUploadedImagesChange` prop
- ✅ Passes callback to ImageUploadSection

### 3. CreationWorkspace Component ✅
- ✅ Added `uploadedImages` state
- ✅ Added `handleUploadedImagesChange` callback
- ✅ Passes uploaded images to AIGenerationDemo

### 4. AIGenerationDemo Component ✅
- ✅ Added `uploadedImages` prop to interface
- ✅ Updated generation logic with priority: Canvas > Uploaded Images > Text-only
- ✅ Added visual indicators for input mode
- ✅ Added information about which image will be used

## Data Flow Architecture

```
ImageUploadSection 
    ↓ (onImagesChange callback)
RightSidebar 
    ↓ (onUploadedImagesChange callback)  
CreationWorkspace 
    ↓ (uploadedImages prop)
AIGenerationDemo 
    ↓ (transformImage/generateImage)
AI Service
```

## Priority Logic
1. **Canvas drawing** (highest priority) - if `hasCanvasContent && canvasImageData`
2. **Uploaded images** - if `uploadedImages.length > 0`, uses first image
3. **Text-only generation** (fallback) - pure text-to-image

## Visual Feedback
- Mode indicator shows "图生图模式" vs "文生图模式"
- Info box shows which image source will be used
- Multiple images show count with "使用第1张" indicator

## Expected Behavior
When a user uploads images to the right sidebar:
1. Images are stored in `uploadedImages` state with Base64 URLs
2. AIGenerationDemo receives the image data
3. Generation automatically switches to image-to-image mode
4. First uploaded image is used as input to AI model
5. User sees clear indication of which image is being used

The integration is complete and ready for testing.
